# algorithms visualizer built with tkinter :}

# What is Algorithm visualizer ? 
  simply it's a program that shows you the specific steps that is required for an algorithm to be applied on a data set
  
# How did i built Algorithms Visualizer ? 

  as you can see in the repo, the project has been built using Python programming language. Specifically, Tkinter library used for GUI Implementation.
# Requirements ::
  Of course, Python must be installed in order to use edit and run the source code.
  that's it :) You really don't need anything else. 
  
# Why Tkinter ? 
  Tkinter is a standard python library which make it easy use. in other words, you dont need all these steps to install an external library to edit and run the source code Tkinter got you :}

# Files description : 
  main.py is the main file that will be executed when running the project. Otherwise, YOu have unexpected errors.
  implemented_algorithms.py is the file that contain the implemented algorithms in the project. 
    For now, Bubble sort is the only algorithm implemented in the project. But i hope i the future i will extend the project and implement more algorithms .
    
# Live version ? 
  There are no live version of the project since it's not a web application so, i don't know how to run online. 
  But actually, there is a website that represents the same idea :} you can google it ( yes i will not put the link :} ).
  A better solution would be to download the repo and test it you self. 
  
# o.O compiled files?? 
  I can include some compiled version of the project in case you dont have python installed. The execution version will be found in execution_ver folder.
  Every operating system would have different execution file. I will add linux and windows executable files but for MacOS, it's not available at the moment.

# Errors and exceptions :P
  I have tried to handle as much errors as possible. I have tested the project many times with different data sets. I have already handled a lot of errors and exceptions that the user could do while inputting data to the program. In case i forgot any error that i did not handle, text me on github and i will include it :} 
  
# Conclusion 
  I was working on that project alone :( so, take it easy it's quit hard to manage the time between my life and coding and the project is not easy at all :) 
  So, please consider that i'm a student and a human :) i'm not a robot o.O .
  Thanks for reading i hope you like the project. For suggestions, text me on github or any other possible way :)
